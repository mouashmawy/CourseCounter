# Course Counter Matrix

## Goal
In our university, there are many students that take many different courses from different majors together and Me with some of my collegues have to make a schedule for the final exam without any conflicts (as we are the student represenataives for CIE major).
</br>
This software calculates number of students taking 2 courses together (eg. number of students taking both chem and phys are 108) so that we can make a schedule without any conflicts.

## How it works
This script is made to take the courses registered for each student in the university in an excel and then generate another excel containing matrix of Course Matches - number of students for each registered  courses with another one (eg. number of students taking both chem and phys are 108).
</br>


## Notes
Note 1: This script works on any large data.
</br>
Note 2: Original Matrix of our university isn't attached as it is confidential so you can find an input file file as an example to try
