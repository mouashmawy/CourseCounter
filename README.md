# Course Counter Matrix

## Goal
- In our university, there are many students that take many different courses from different majors together and Me with some of my collegues have to make a schedule for the final exam without any conflicts (as we are the student represenataives for CIE major).

- This software calculates number of students taking 2 courses together (eg. number of students taking both chem and phys are 108) so that we can make a schedule without any conflicts.

## Installs
- installing all packages
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Authors
- Moustafa Ashmawy

## How it works
- This script is made to take the courses registered for each student in the university in an excel and then generate another excel containing matrix of Course Matches - number of students for each registered  courses with another one (eg. number of students taking both chem and phys are 108).


## Added features

- Changed color based on number of matches (ex: matches between 6 and 15 make it yellow) 
- Added comment for every cell with the the courses making matches for easy searching 



## Notes
- Note 1: This script works on any large data.
- Note 2: Original Matrix of our university isn't attached as it is confidential so you can find an input file file as an example to try
